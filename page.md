### what's this for:
i'm doing this for hack club's personal site YSWS, (page)[https://page.hackclub.com/]!

basically, i just want to mess around with some cool features instead of a standard (and lowk really mid) static site. so this'll be my list/devlog(? ive never actually done devlogs before so i'm kinda just messing around. i'll figure it out though! :D)
